    <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef, 80% lean and 20% fat</li>
        <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choice, such as lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, and condiments</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the grill to high heat.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix gently with your hands until just combined, being careful not to overwork the meat.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties, about 1/2 inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent them from puffing up during cooking.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on the grill and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until the desired level of doneness is achieved.</li>
        <li>During the last minute of cooking, toast the hamburger buns on the grill until lightly charred.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers by placing the cooked patties on the bottom buns and topping them with your favorite toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, and condiments. Cover with the top buns and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
